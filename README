src/analysis    : model and data assimilation source code
src/diagnostic  : IDL code to analyze the model output
src/utils       : utilities to build pft and topography maps, download MODIS data or process ECMWF data
data/ini        : experiment namelists, parameters, observation forcing and state namelists for each experiment
data/parameters : local and regional parameter files for predictions
data/sites      : geographical domains and names of sites/regions are defined here
scripts         : these are the perl-based wrapper scripts to run the Pheno Analysis framework
