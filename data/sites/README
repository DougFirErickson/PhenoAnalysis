xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax give the coordinate boundaries in the units
of the chosen coordinate system. xmin is the left edge of the leftmost
gridbox, where xmax is the right edge of the rightmost gridbox. The
bounds thus refer to grid box boundaries and not grid box centers. Except
for a single point location, where xmin, xmax (and ymin, ymax, respectively) 
give a singular (centered) value.

The coordinate systems and optional parameters are following the Grid Mapping
description of the NetCDF CF Convention.

CF Grid Mapping is based itself on the FGDC "Content Standard for 
Digital Geospatial Metadata" [FGDC].
