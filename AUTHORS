This project was performed at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Colorado State University, 80523 Fort Collins, CO USA, under supervision of Prof. Dr. A.S. Denning.
The NASA Energy and Water Cycle Study (NEWS) grant No. NNG06CG42G is the main funding source of this study. Computing resources were mainly provided by sub-contract 2207-06-016 issued by Science System and Application Inc. through NASA contract NAS5-02041.

The final part of this project was developed at MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland. 

Many thanks go to Scott Denning and his Biocycle research group for financial and intellectual support. I would like to especially acknowledge all my satellite remote sensing research collegues at NASA / Goddard Space Flight Center and scientific discussions on ensemble data assimilation with Arif Albayrak, Dusanka Zupanski and Milija Zupanski.
Many thanks to MeteoSwiss (Climate Services, Climate Analysis) for supporting the final development and publication of this project.
